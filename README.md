## Project Structure

The project consists of the following sheets in the Excel workbook:

- **Data Sheet:** Contains the cleaned and processed data after performing data cleaning, merging, and transformations using Power Query. The raw data, originally in three separate sheets, has been consolidated and enriched with new columns for analysis purposes.

- **Analysis Sheet:** Contains pivot tables that summarize and visualize key insights from the cleaned data. It presents correlations between employee attrition and various parameters, including salary hikes, performance ratings, department-wise attrition, and other relevant factors impacting attrition.

- **Dashboard Sheet:** Hosts the interactive dashboard with dynamic visualizations and slicers. The dashboard utilizes the cleaned data to present key findings and allow users to interactively explore the data.


## Project Highlights

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** The raw data extracted from Kaggle, distributed across multiple sheets, has been cleaned, merged, and processed using Power Query. This ensures data integrity and accuracy for analysis.

2. **Multi-Parameter Analysis:** The analysis sheet contains pivot tables exploring various parameters influencing attrition, such as salary hikes, performance ratings, department-wise attrition, and more. This comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of employee churn patterns.

3. **Interactive Dashboard:** The dashboard sheet features an intuitive and interactive interface, allowing users to filter and visualize data through slicers, charts, and graphs. It enables HR professionals and management to gain actionable insights.

4. **In-Depth Insights:** The project delves into HR attrition trends, identifies potential risk areas, and highlights opportunities for employee retention strategies. The visualization of data aids in better decision-making.
